The app being developed is a banking app that would allow the users to manually populate forms that hold dates and balances of upcoming bills that are due.
The app would do this through just a few activities and no access to the internet would be required. Users would be able to log in to the app after entering
a username and password. Once logged in, users would have access to a scrolling list of bills due along with the amount due. Bills would be ordered from closest due to farthest out.
Once a bill is selected, users could delete it, mark it as important or edit it. Adding new bills would be easy as there is just one button to do so.
